https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/commit/c606a00798a7f516c37c67a708864f9a3eb9f796,"Deal with relative url root installations

This commit allows OmniAuth to handle relative url root installations
by correctly prefixing the default `Strategy#request_path` and
`Strategy#callback_path` with `SCRIPT_NAME` as provided by Rack.

Also, in order to detect the full current path, uses
`Rack::Request#path` instead of `#path_info`, as the latter does not
include SCRIPT_NAME.

A deeper question remains: What should happen with custom callback and
request paths? I can't think of a case where a user with a relative url
root installation would *not* want to prefix its paths, regardless of
setting a custom path or not.
However, since some people may have configured custom paths in order to
deal with relative root, including this change may be breaking.",,,

According to the documentation:

> RETURN VALUE
>       posix_fallocate() returns zero on success, or an error number on failure.  Note that errno is not set.

Since errno is not set by `posix_fallocate` potentially confusing error
messages can be printed since `h2o_perror` (called below) expects errno
to be set appropriately.

This change fixes this, so that h2o will print correct error messages if
`posix_fallocate` fails.",,,

The template compiler was applying IMPLICIT tags to CHOICE types.  This
is very wrong, as the tag of a CHOICE's taken choice cannot be replaced
without making it impossible to figure out what the choice was.  An
example of this is GeneralName's directoryName, which is an IMPLICIT-
tagged CHOICE.

Separately, the non-template compiler was requiring inlining of
IMPLICIT-tagged CHOICEs, which also happens in GeneralName's
directoryName case:

```
    205 Name ::= CHOICE {
    206         rdnSequence  RDNSequence
    207 }
    ...
    287 GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
    288         otherName                       [0]     IMPLICIT -- OtherName --
    SEQUENCE {
    289                 type-id    OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    290                 value      [0] EXPLICIT heim_any
    291         },
    292         rfc822Name                      [1]     IMPLICIT IA5String,
    293         dNSName                         [2]     IMPLICIT IA5String,
    294 --      x400Address                     [3]     IMPLICIT ORAddress,--
--->295         directoryName                   [4]     IMPLICIT -- Name -- CHOICE
    {
    296                 rdnSequence  RDNSequence
    297         },
    298 --      ediPartyName                    [5]     IMPLICIT EDIPartyName, --
    299         uniformResourceIdentifier       [6]     IMPLICIT IA5String,
    300         iPAddress                       [7]     IMPLICIT OCTET STRING,
    301         registeredID                    [8]     IMPLICIT OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    302 }
```

Anyways, that's fixed now, though changing that will require making
corresponding changes to `lib/hx509/`.

We're getting closer to parity between the two compilers.  The template
compiler is still missing support for `SET { ... }` types.  Speaking of
`SET { ... }`, the regular compiler generates code that uses `qsort()`
to sort the encoded values values of the members of such a set, but this
seems silly because the order of members is knowable at compile time, as
for DER and CER the order by the tags of the members, from lowest to
highest (see X.690, section 9.3 and X.680, section 8.6).  As it happens
using `qsort()` on the encodings of the members works, but it would be
be better to sort in `lib/asn1/asn1parse.y` and then not have to bother
anywhere else.  Sorting SETs at definition time will help keep the
tamplate compiler simple.  Not that we _need_ `SET { ... }` for anything
in-tree other than the X.690 sample...

While we're at it, let's note that the core of PKIX from the RFC
2459/3280/5280/5912 consists of *two* ASN.1 modules, one with
default-EXPLICIT tags, and one with default-IMPLICIT tags, and
Heimdal has these merged as a default-EXPLICIT tags module in
`lib/asn1/rfc2459.asn1`, with `IMPLICIT` added in by hand in all the
tags in the default-IMPLICIT tagged module.  This fixes one recently
added type from PKIX that didn't have `IMPLICIT` added in manually!",,,
https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/0729692cc815ad540ee2e61f3ce93c878b2c35ee,"asn1: Templates work for IMPLICIT; add build opt

Finally.  We're almost at parity for the template compiler.

Now we have a build option to use templating:

    `./configure --enable-asn1-templating`

Tests fail if you build `rfc2459.asn1` with `--template`.

TBD: Figure out what differences remain between the two compilers, and
     fix the templating compiler accordingly, adding tests along the
     way.

Making IMPLICIT tags work in the templating compiler turned out to be a
simple fix: don't attempt to do anything clever about IMPLICIT tags in
the template generator in the compiler other than denoting them --
instead leave all the smarts about IMPLICIT tags to the interpreter.
This might be a very slight pessimization, but also a great
simplification.

The result is very elegant: when the interpreter finds an IMPLICIT
tag it then recurses to find the template for the body of the type
so-tagged, and evaluates that.  Much more elegant than the code
generated by the non-template compiler, not least for not needing
any additional temporary memory allocation.

With this we finally have parity in basic testing of the template
compiler.  Indeed, for IMPLICIT tags the template compiler and
interpreter might even be better because they support IMPLICIT tags
with BER lengths, whereas the non-template compiler doesn't (mostly
because `der_replace_tag()` needs to be changed to support it.

And, of course, the template compiler is simply superior in that it
produces smaller code and is *much* easier to work with because the
functions to interpret templates are small and simple.  Which means we
can add more functions to deal with other encoding rules fairly
trivially.  It should be possible to add all of these with very little
work, almost all of it localized to `lib/asn1/template.c`:

 - PER  Packed Encoding Rules [X.691]
 - XER  XML Encoding Rules    [X.693]
 - OER  Octet Encoding Rules  [X.696] (intended to replace PER)
 - JER  JSON Encoding Rules   [X.697] (doubles as visual representation)
 - GSER Generic String E.R.s  [RFC3641] (a visual representation)

 - XDR  External Data Repr.   [STD67][RFC4506]

       (XDR is *not* an ASN.1 encoding rules specification, but it's a
        *lot* like PER/OER but with 4-octet alignment, and is specified
        for the syntax equivalent (XDR) of only a subset of ASN.1 syntax
        and semantics.)

All we'd have to do is add variants of `_asn1_{length,encode,decode}()`
for each set of rules, then generate per-type stub functions that call
them (as we already do for DER).

We could then have an encoding rule transliteration program that takes a
`TypeName` and some representation of a value encoded by some encoding
rules, and outputs the same thing encoded by a different set of rules.
This would double as a pretty-printer and parser if we do add support
for JER and/or GSER.  It would find the template for the given type
using `dlsym()` against some shared object (possibly `libasn1` itself).

Whereas generating source code for C (or whatever language) for
additional ERs requires much more work.  Plus, templates are much
smaller, and the interpreter is tiny, which yields much smaller text and
much smaller CPU icache/dcache footprint, which yields better
performance in many cases.

As well, the template system should be much easier to port to other
languages.  Though in the cases of, e.g., Rust, it would require use of
`unsafe` in the interpreter, so in fact the inverse might be true: that
it's easier to generate safe Rust code than to implement a template
interpreter in Rust.  Similarly for Haskell, OCAML, etc.  But wherever
the template interpreter is easy to implement, it's a huge win.

Note that implementing OER and PER using the templates as they are
currently would be a bit of a challenge, as the interpreter would have
to first do a pass of each SEQUENCE/SET to determine the size and
layout of the OER/PER sequence/set preamble by counting the number of
OPTIONAL/DEFAULT members, BOOLEAN members, and extensibility markers
with extensions present.  We could always generate more entries to
encode precomputed preamble metadata.  We would also need to add a
template entry type for extensibility markers, which currently we do
not.",,,

So now we compile `lib/asn1/test.asn1` both, w/ and w/o templating, and

`check-gen-template`, respectively linking with the non-templated and
the templated compilation of `lib/asn1/test.asn1`.

tag of each type.  This is needed so the decoder functions generated by
the compiler can know what tag to restore.

Checking the error code of decoding a blob as an hdb_entry or
hdb_entry_alias to determine which of those the blob is depends on a
detail of the Heimdal ASN.1 compiler and library that shouldn't be
depended on.  Using a CHOICE adds no octets to the encoding:

    HDB-EntryOrAlias ::= CHOICE {
            entry       hdb_entry,
            alias       hdb_entry_alias
    }

since we're adding no additional tags and the two arms of the CHOICE
already differ in tag (hdb_entry's tag is a [UNIVERSAL Sequence] tag,
while hdb_entry_alias's is an [APPLICATION 0] tag).",,,

This commit _mostly_ fixes the Heimdal ASN.1 compiler to properly
support IMPLICIT tagging in most if not all the many cases where it
didn't already, as you could see in lib/asn1/canthandle.asn1 prior to
this commit.

This fix is a bit of a hack in that a proper fix would change the
function prototypes of the encode/decode/length functions generated by
the compiler to take an optional IMPLICIT tag to tag with instead of the
type they code.  That fix would not be localized to lib/asn1/ however,
and would change the API and ABI of generated code (which is mostly not
an ABI for Heimdal, but still, some external projects would have to make
changes).

Instead, for IMPLICIT tags we currently depend on the IMPLICIT tag and
the sub-type's tag having the same size -- this can be fixed with extra
allocation on the encoder side as we do on the decoder side, but we
might leave it for later.

The issue we're fixing manifested as:

  -- The [CONTEXT 0] tag in Bar below was turned into an EXPLICIT tag
  -- instead of an IMPLICIT one, netting the DER encoding for the `foo`
  -- member as:
  --    [CONTEXT 0] [UNIVERSAL Seq] [UNIVERSAL Int] <encoding of i>
  -- instead of the correct:
  --    [CONTEXT 0] [UNIVERSAL Int] <encoding of i>
  Foo ::= SEQUENCE { i INTEGER }
  Bar ::= SEQUENCE { foo [0] IMPLICIT Foo }

or

  Foo ::= INTEGER
  Bar ::= SEQUENCE { foo [0] IMPLICIT Foo } -- tag context 0 marked
                                            -- constructed!

I've reviewed this in part by reviewing the output of the compiler
before and after this change using this procedure:

 - Run an earlier version of the ASN.1 compiler output for all
   modules in lib/asn1/.  Save these in a different location.

 - Run this (or later) version of the ASN.1 compiler output for
   the same modules, adding --original-order for modules that
   have been manually sorted already (e.g., rfc2459.asn1).

 - Run clang-format on the saved and newest generated C source
   and header files.

 - Diff the generated output.  Substantial differences will
   relate to handling of IMPLICIT tagging.  These are
   particularly evident in the tcg.asn1 module, which uses a lot
   of those.

Later commits add test data (certificates with extensions that use
IMPLICIT tagging) taken from external specifications as well, which
exercise this fix.

Non-urgent brokenness yet to be fixed:

 - When the IMPLICIT tag and the tag of the underlying type require
   differing numbers of bytes to encode, the encoding and decoding will
   fail.  The prototypes of generated length_*() functions make it
   impossible to do much better.

 - SET OF <primitive> still crashes the compiler (not a new bug).

Futures:

 - Unwind hackery in cms.asn1 that worked around our lack of proper
   IMPLICIT tagging support.

Here are some of the generated code deltas one expects to see around

    diff -ubw /tmp/save/$i $i

and one should see deltas such as the following:

 - a small enhancement to handling of OPTIONAL members:

     (data)->macData = calloc(1, sizeof(*(data)->macData));
     if ((data)->macData == NULL)
       goto fail;
     e = decode_PKCS12_MacData(p, len, (data)->macData, &l);
-    if (e) {
+    if (e == ASN1_MISSING_FIELD) {
       free((data)->macData);
       (data)->macData = NULL;
+    } else if (e) {
+      goto fail;
     } else {
       p += l;
       len -= l;
       ret += l;

 - more complete handling of DEFAULTed members:

     e = decode_FWReceiptVersion(p, len, &(data)->version, &l);
-    if (e)
+    if (e == ASN1_MISSING_FIELD) {
+      (data)->version = 1;
+    } else if (e) {
       goto fail;
-    p += l;
-    len -= l;
-    ret += l;
+    } else {
+      p += l;
+      len -= l;
+      ret += l;
+    }
     {

 - replacement of tags with implicit tags (encode side):

   /* targetUri */
   if ((data)->targetUri) {
     size_t Top_tag_oldret HEIMDAL_UNUSED_ATTRIBUTE = ret;
     ret = 0;
     e = encode_URIReference(p, len, (data)->targetUri, &l);
     if (e)
       return e;
     p -= l;
     len -= l;
     ret += l;

-    e = der_put_length_and_tag(p, len, ret, ASN1_C_CONTEXT, PRIM, 4, &l);
+    e = der_replace_tag(p, len, ASN1_C_CONTEXT, CONS, 4);
     if (e)
       return e;
     p -= l;
     len -= l;
     ret += l;

     ret += Top_tag_oldret;
   }

 - replacement of tags with implicit tags (decode side):

         strengthOfFunction_oldlen = len;
         if (strengthOfFunction_datalen > len) {
           e = ASN1_OVERRUN;
           goto fail;
         }
         len = strengthOfFunction_datalen;
-        e = decode_StrengthOfFunction(p, len, (data)->strengthOfFunction, &l);
-        if (e)
-          goto fail;
-        p += l;
-        len -= l;
-        ret += l;
+        {
+          unsigned char *pcopy;
+          pcopy = calloc(1, len);
+          if (pcopy == 0) {
+            e = ENOMEM;
+            goto fail;
+          }
+          memcpy(pcopy, p, len);
+          e = der_replace_tag(pcopy, len, ASN1_C_UNIV, PRIM, 0);
+          if (e)
+            goto fail;
+          e = decode_StrengthOfFunction(p, len, (data)->strengthOfFunction, &l);
+          if (e)
+            goto fail;
+          p += l;
+          len -= l;
+          ret += l;
+          free(pcopy);
+        }
         len = strengthOfFunction_oldlen - strengthOfFunction_datalen;
       }
     }
     {
       size_t profileOid_datalen, profileOid_oldlen;

 - correct determination of implicit tag constructed vs no for IMPLICT-
   tagged named primitive types:

     {
       size_t profileUri_datalen, profileUri_oldlen;
       Der_type profileUri_type;
       e = der_match_tag_and_length(p, len, ASN1_C_CONTEXT, &profileUri_type, 2,
                                    &profileUri_datalen, &l);
-      if (e == 0 && profileUri_type != PRIM) {
+      if (e == 0 && profileUri_type != CONS) {
         e = ASN1_BAD_ID;
       }
       if (e) {
         (data)->profileUri = NULL;
       } else {
         (data)->profileUri = calloc(1, sizeof(*(data)->profileUri));
         if ((data)->profileUri == NULL) {
           e = ENOMEM;
           goto fail;
         }

 - correct determination of length of IMPLICT-tagged OIDs:

   if ((data)->profileOid) {
     size_t Top_tag_oldret = ret;
     ret = 0;
     ret += der_length_oid((data)->profileOid);
+    ret += 1 + der_length_len(ret);
     ret += Top_tag_oldret;
   }

These deltas should be examined with the corresponding ASN.1 module at
hand, cross-referencing the source code to the ASN.1 type definitions
and manually applying X.690 rules to double-check the choices of
primitive vs. constructed tag, and the choices of when to replace tags
and when not.",,,

 - Giving asn1_compile the name of an ASN.1 module w/o the "".asn1"" stem
   will cause the compiler to add the "".asn1"" stem, and it will cause

 - The default C module name substring derivation from the .asn1 file
   name is improved.

 - There is now a --gen-name=NAME option for specifying the C module
   name substring.  This is useful for specifying that in a .opt file.

 - More options now have helpful usage messages.

This will allow simplification of lib/asn1/Makefile.am's invocations of
asn1_compile.

https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/83d4c6ddb59b4c922db7d654871397f71a846888,"asn1: Circular types and Topo. sort declarations

Many external ASN.1 modules that we have imported over time define types
like this:

  Foo ::= SEQUENCE { bar Bar }
  Bar ::= SEQUENCE { aMember INTEGER }

and before this change one had to re-order the definitions so that the
one for `Bar` came first.  No more.

We can now have out of order definitions in ASN.1 modules and the
compiler will topologically sort output C type declarations so that one
no longer has to manually sort types in ASN.1 modules when importing
them.

Besides that, it is now possible to create circular data types using
OPTIONAL since we generate such fields as pointers (which can then be
pointers to incomplete struct declarations):

  Circular ::= SEQUENCE {
          name UTF8String,
          next Circular OPTIONAL
  }

Circular types aren't necessarily useful, but they have been used in the
past.  E.g., the rpc.mountd protocol uses a circular type as a linked
list -- it should just have used an array, of course, as that's
semantically equivalent but more space efficient in its encoding, but
the point is that such types exist out there.",,,

* Correct argument of AJAX client side callbacks

* Fix typing of parameter msg of PrimeFaces.confirm / PrimeFaces.dialog.DialogHandler.confirm
* Fix type annotation
* Remove PrimeFaces.widget.ConfirmDialog.ConfirmDialogMessage.onShow and add beforeShow and icon properties

* Unintended behavior fix

The method encodeListLayout will end abruptly if the pageSize is greater
than the number of elements in the dataView. Thus,
writer.endElement(""ul"") and dataview.setRowIndex(-1) will not be called.

* Fix #6876: show ""No records found."" message if DataView has no elements

IntegrationTestImportTsv is generating HFiles under the working directory of the
current hdfs user executing the tool, before bulkloading it into HBase.

Assuming you encrypt the HBase root directory within HDFS (using HDFS
Transparent Encryption), you can bulkload HFiles only if they sit in the same
encryption zone in HDFS as the HBase root directory itself.

When IntegrationTestImportTsv is executed against a real distributed cluster
and the working directory of the current user (e.g. /user/hbase) is not in the
same encryption zone as the HBase root directory (e.g. /hbase/data) then you
will get an exception:

```
ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegion: There was a partial failure
due to IO when attempting to load d :
hdfs://mycluster/user/hbase/test-data/22d8460d-04cc-e032-88ca-2cc20a7dd01c/

can't be moved into an encryption zone.
```

In this commit I make it configurable where the IntegrationTestImportTsv
generates the HFiles.

* PoolMap does not discard any elements anymore. If an element is put,

RpcClients can reference netty ByteBufs which are reference counted.
Resource cleanup is done by AbstractRpcClient.cleanupIdleConnections().
* PoolMap does not implement Map interface anymore, so ensuring
thread-safety has become easier. Put method is replaced with getOrCreate().
* ThreadLocalPool doesn't use ThreadLocal class anymore. It stores
resources on thread basis, but it doesn't remove values when a thread
exits. Again, proper cleanup is done by cleanupIdleConnections().

It adds load balance support for meta lookup in AsyncTableRegionLocator.
The existing meta replica mode is renamed as ""HedgedRead"", client sends scan request to the primary meta replica region first,
if response is not back within a configured amount of time, it will send scan requests to all meta replica regions and
take the first response. On top of the existing mode, a new mode ""LoadBalance"" is introduced. In this mode, client first
choose a meta replica region to send scan request. If the response is stale, it may send the request to another meta replica region or
the primary region. In this mode, meta scan requests are load balanced across all replica regions with the primary mode as
the ultimate source of truth.

Two new config knobs are added:

1. hbase.locator.meta.replicas.mode
   Valid options are ""None"", ""HedgedRead"" and ""LoadBalance"", they are case insensitive. The default mode is ""None"".

2. hbase.locator.meta.replicas.mode.loadbalance.selector
   The load balance alogrithm to select a meta replica to send the requests.
   Only org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.CatalogReplicaLoadBalanceReplicaSimpleSelector.class
   is supported for now, which is the default as well. The algorithm works as follows:
      a. Clients select a randome meta replica region to send the requests if there is no entry for the location in the stale
         location cache.
      b. If the location from one meta replica region is stale, a stale entry will be created in the statle location cache
         for the region.
      c. Clients select the primary meta region if the location is in the stale location cache.
      d. The stale location cache entries time out in 3 seconds.

If there is no ""hbase.locator.meta.replicas.mode"" configured, it will check the config knob ""hbase.meta.replicas.use"".
If ""hbase.meta.replicas.use"" is configured, the mode will be set to ""HedgedRead"".",,,

* HBASE-25055 Add ReplicationSource for meta WALs; add enable/disable when hbase:meta assigned to RS

Fill in gap left by HBASE-11183 'Timeline Consistent region replicas - Phase 2 design'.
HBASE-11183 left off implementing 'async WAL Replication' on the hbase:meta
Table; hbase:meta Table could only do Phase 1 Region Replicas reading
the primary Regions' hfiles. Here we add 'async WAL Replication' to
hbase:meta so Replicas can be more current with the primary's changes.

Adds a 'special' ReplicationSource that reads hbase:meta WAL files and replicates
all edits to the configured in-cluster endpoint (Defaults to the
RegionReadReplicaEndpoint.class -- set hbase.region.replica.catalog.replication to
target a different endpoint implementation).

Set hbase.region.replica.replication.catalog.enabled to enable async WAL
Replication for hbase:meta region replicas. Its off by default.

The CatalogReplicationSource for async WAL Replication of hbase:meta does
NOT need to keep up WAL offset or a queue of WALs-to-replicate in the
replication queue store as is done in other ReplicationSource implementations;
the CatalogReplicationSource is for Region Replicas only. General
Replication does not replicate hbase:meta. hbase:meta Region Replicas reset
on crash of the primary replica so there is no need to 'recover'
replication that was running on the crashed server.

Because it so different in operation, the CatalogReplicationSource is bolted
on to the side of the ReplicationSourceManager. It is lazily
instantiated to match the lazy instantiation of the hbase:meta
WALProvider, created and started on the open of the first Region of an
hbase:meta table. Thereafter it stays up till the process dies, even if
all hbase:meta Regions have moved off the server, in case a hbase:meta
Region is moved back (Doing this latter simplifies the implementation)

hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/regionserver/HRegionServer.java

If hbase.regionserver.close.wait.abort is set to true, interrupt RPC
handler threads holding the region close lock.

Until requests in progress can be aborted, wait on the region close lock for
a configurable interval (specified by hbase.regionserver.close.wait.time.ms,
default 60000 (1 minute)). If we have failed to acquire the close lock after
this interval elapses, if allowed (also specified by
hbase.regionserver.close.wait.abort), abort the regionserver.

We will attempt to interrupt any running handlers every
hbase.regionserver.close.wait.interval.ms (default 10000 (10 seconds)) until
either the close lock is acquired or we reach the maximum wait time.

Define a subset of region operations as interruptible. Track threads holding
the close lock transiting those operations. Set the thread interrupt status
of tracked threads when trying to close the region. Use the thread interrupt
status where safe to break out of request processing.

The core change here is to the loop in

loop that walks the table's region chain once, looking for contiguous
sequences of regions that meet the criteria for merge. The outer loop
tracks the starting point of the next sequence, the inner loop looks
for the end of that sequence. A single sequence becomes an instance of
`MergeNormalizationPlan`.

IntegrationTestImportTsv is generating HFiles under the working directory of the
current hdfs user executing the tool, before bulkloading it into HBase.

Assuming you encrypt the HBase root directory within HDFS (using HDFS
Transparent Encryption), you can bulkload HFiles only if they sit in the same
encryption zone in HDFS as the HBase root directory itself.

When IntegrationTestImportTsv is executed against a real distributed cluster
and the working directory of the current user (e.g. /user/hbase) is not in the
same encryption zone as the HBase root directory (e.g. /hbase/data) then you
will get an exception:

```
ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegion: There was a partial failure

https://github.com/vmware/xenon/commit/5291cbe790b14e81ba7b746af26c75dbfaffce35,"Samples: Unique ID generator service

There are two components to ID generator service.

1. Stateless Service that generates the IDs: This is the main service
used by the user to get a new cluster-wide unique ID. This service
exposes single API to get the unique ID. This is stateless service
and can generate thousands of IDs without calling the stateful range
generator service described below. It initializes its in-memory
counter with the lower limit of the range and It starts outputting
unique IDs starting from the lower end of the range and keeps
incrementing its in-memory till it reaches the max limit of the range.
Upon reaching the max it initializes its counter with the min value
of the next range and repeats the process. Because this is stateless
service not needing to coordinate with another service and not needed
to persist anything, its throughput will be very good. The problem of
delay in getting next range after reaching the end of the previous
range is solved by pre-pulling a new range when the previous range is
consumed more than half its values. Every node in the cluster will
be running an instance of this service, that enables any consumer
service on this cluster to get a new unique ID locally. Each range
once received by this service will not be given to any other instance.
This ensures the uniqueness of the IDs across the cluster. There could
be the cases that a node goes down after receiving a new range, after
the restart, this node will request a new range because the previous
range was in memory and lost. The occasional lost of some ranges will
not hurt our system because we have many ranges to give in a 64 bit
integer.

2. Stateful Service that generates ranges for the Stateless
service: This is replicated, owner-selected and persistent service
with a full quorum. It stores the maximum value (maxId) that has been
supplied to the stateless ID generator service. Any range request will
provide a range which will be (maxId, maxId + range-interval).

https://jira.eng.vmware.com/browse/VRXEN-52

When a service gets into a STOPPED state and an inbound request
arrives for it before it gets removed from attached services,
a reference to the service from the operation processing chain
context is never cleared, and a spiral of ODL messages is
generated. The fix is to clear the reference to the service
from the context.

This introduces a -Dxenon.LogFormatter.LOG_DATE_FIRST flag that signals
to xenon logging to output the timestamp as the first item in the log

If GC logs are enabled (along with this flag), you might see this in the

When a persistent service expires, seems like there's a time window -
before the index service detects the expiration (triggered by
periodic maintenance) and clears it from both the index and
from cache - where the service' state will be served from
cache, despite the fact that it's expired.

A simple test, added to LuceneDocumentIndexService, demonstrates the
problem.

The situation where the cache serves a state despite the fact that
it's not returned from the index service (the service index behaves
correctly here and does not return expired documents) is causing
inconsistency and might also explain:

A single instance of ShardsManagementService - the shards manager -
is created when the default nodegroup is available. The shards manager
translates a sharding key-value, as specified by a client, to a shard
id, and creates a shard (including allocating nodes for the shard) in

Mapping of key-values to the same shard as well as sharing a host
between two different shards can be allowed or disallowed, based on

On-demand start of a Stateful, persistent, non-replicated service that
does not exist leaves an attached service instance footprint in memory.

Typically when the target service of an operation is a child service
of a persistent factory, on-demand start kicks-in, but fails because
the service does not exist. The detection of non-existence typically
happens in the synchronization phase of the service start sequence.
However, in the case of a non-replicated service, synchornization
is skipped, and we ignore the non-existence. Note that even without
the fix the on-demand triggering op fails, as it should, as linked
state loading fails. However, memory footprint is left - the attached
service instance.

Added a test to cover this case.

Add support for synchronization of all versions:

* SynchronizationTaskService has an additional state field that controls
  whether all versions, not just the latest, should be synchronized
* 3 new pragmas have been added: PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_ALL_VERSIONS,
  PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_HISTORICAL_VERSIONS and PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_VERSION
* SynchronizationTaskService drives synchronization of factory children as
  usual, except that when synch-all-versions is enabled - it sets
  PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_ALL_VERSIONS on the synchOwner request it sends
  through the factory to the service owner
* A synchOwner request with PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_ALL_VERSIONS is handled at
  the service owner side in two stages: in the first stage a regular
  synchOwner flow is executed. In the second stage only versions lower
  than the last version, if exist, are synchronized.
* NodeSelectorSynchronizationService uses a paginated broadcast + include-
  all-versions + numeric-range query to fetch the historical versions of the
  service and synchronize its peers.

While the infrastructure supports a per-factory config of synching the
latest or all version, currently only a global config is exposed through
the system property
xenon.SynchronizationTaskService.synchAllVersions.

Previously, accessing the paginated searcher cache is scattered around the
index-service code base.
In this commit, `PaginatedSearcherManager` class is introduced inside of
index-service and put all paginated searcher cache management into this class.
This doesn't change any functionality, rather it is a code cleanup of
index-service.

As part of the change, `PaginatedSearcherInfo` class is also moved to the
inside of the manager class.  Since this info class is internal to the cache,
ideally this should be scoped to private.  However, due to the references from
current test class, scope is kept as protected.

To verify existing functionality, I have not yet refactored the test class.
However, test class has many internal access to the paginated searcher cache
related code, they need to be cleaned up and separate testing for cache
management and general paginated searcher usage.
The test class refactoring is not part of the scope of this change.

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1471320/stories/152518950

During synchronization we issue a broadcast paginated query to find the

relatively short timeout - a 1/3 of the host operation's timeout - which
times out under heavy load (typically when netty connections expire which
causes a delay).

The fix is to use the full host operation's timeout, which can be set
by the application to deal with heavy load.

This change aims to do this:
* introduce a single entrypoint to access global config params from the
   environemnt

* Promote convention when introducing config params in the form of
  InterestedClass.propName. All configs that don't adhere to this convention
  are still read the old way.

* Enable reading configs from both sysprops and env vars: these two are
  equivalent:
  -Dxenon.MyConfigs.key=value
  export XENON_MY_CONFIG_KEY=value

  This makes it easier to parameterize xenon when run in container/pod.
  Inspired by https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig.

* User friendliness: durations can be given in millis, seconds,
  minutes, hours, days; micros are the default. These are equivalent:
  1h = 3600s = 3600000ms = 3600000000

* User friendliness: number parameters understand K,M,G suffixes. These
  are all equivalent:
  1M = 1m = 1024K = 1024k = ....

* Standadrd API to modify/restore configuration for test

* Clean-up constants used only in a scope of a few line (the property names and
  defaults)

* Debuggability: during host start, all properties read log why they get this
  value and whether the default is used (inspired by Java's  -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal)

All places when a config is read are changed to use the new API. This API is
not considered public yet. It may be advertised as such once stable enough.

1. Disable http2 for synch post operations. Currently HTTP2 netty
   stack is not processing all pending HTTP2 request in time which
   causes these sync posts to timeout. We should enable HTTP2
   as soon as we have fixed the timeout issue. Due to this bug,
   synchronization would consistently fail for large number of
   documents in 3 or more node cluster where a new node need to get
   synched.

2. Disable early expiration of synch operation. The quick expiration
   of operation in the synch task is not required.

3. Increase query task's expiration that is inherited by all child
   query tasks and broadcast queries and pages. This fixes major issue
   where some query pages were getting expired right after after
   creation if they were created after 10 minutes expiry of the parent
   query task.

4. Logs showing progress of synch task which is really helpful in
   troubleshooting and debugging.

5. Increase synch task exponential backoff retries from 8 to 10.
   The 10th retry will happen after around 17 minutes.

6. Gradually decrease query result limit on failures. Currently
   default result limit is 1000, but on failure we do the retry of
   synch task, which will now retry with half of the previous result
   limit until it has reached lower limit.

7. Synch task to start again as soon as there is node-group change.
   Previously we waited for all documents to be synched before
   starting the synch task again and causing the synch task to finish
   after long time because it would have finished synchronizing all
   thousands of services multiple times.

When queries run in parallel with updates new searchers are created.
The searchers have to parse the FieldInfo from the disk and store it
indexed by name and number (as a FieldInfos instance). In a highly loaded
system the heap is dominiated by FieldInfo(s) instances while the unique
set of objects measures only in the thousands.

A bug in lucene FieldInfos (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8018)
prevents a TreeMap from being gc'ed as a view over it is retained.
The fix is to create a copy of the collection thus making
the parent TreeMap unreachable. Until we update to lucene 7.2 or 8.0,
the field is reassigned using reflection.

This reduces GC pressure a lot if a lot of
query tasks and paginated searcher are needed by an application.

When a request arrives for a service that is attached but not available (the
service is in the process of starting), the ServiceAvailabilityFilter uses
ServiceHost.registerForServiceAvailability() to resume processing the request
once the service becomes available. That method however only signals completion
when the service becomes available, hence if the service fails to start it does
not invoke the completion. This causes CI failures in tests that issue
interleaving operations with STOP or DELETE.

The fix is to introduce a capability to register for service start completion,
whether the completion is successful or not; and use it in
ServiceAvailabilityFilter.

This is covered by:
* onDemandServiceStopCheckWithReadAndWriteAccess
* serviceHostRestartWithDurableServices

Previously, for auth check in index-service remote get, it was using
""op.getBody(ServiceDocument.class)"" to cast the document to ServiceDocument
and passed it to auth filters after it retrieves document from lucene.
When auth filter checks a field that is not part of ServiceDocument(e.g:
tenantLink), auth check was failing because the field was not found on
document passed to the auth filter.  This was due to
""op.getBody(ServiceDocument.class)"" down cast the instance to
ServiceDocument and all data defined in actual state class were lost.

In this change, instead of using ""op.getBody()"" use ""op.getBodyRaw()"" to
keep the original document object.
This logic is called just after document object retrieval from lucene and
kryo deserialized to the target state object; Thus, op always contains
actual instance in target document state.
Then, all child document specific fields are available in auth filters.

Aims to fix 2 problems with the way Xenon serialize/deserialize
untyped collections.

problem #1: custom Map<String,Object> converter deserialize complex
object as json String.

While this might seems reasonable, this break idempotence of
serialize/deserialize function. Specifically after one
serialize/deserialize round Object has become a json String,
if serialized again we end-up with stringified JSON in place
of original JSON.

This is typically affect services propagating data from nested
calls to their callers (with actual remote calls).

On the other, default gson behavior (that probably motivated
the current solution) of deserializing objects as linkedlist
is inadequate. Instead for maximum flexibility we should keep
objects as JsonElements in order to allow further deserializations
when types are known.

e.g.
  for (Object o: document.objectSet) {
    // convert to a known type
    KnownDocumentType k= Utils.fromJson(o, KnownDocumentType.class);
    // manipulate as generic key value map
    Map map = Utils.fromJson(o, Map.class);
    // or just manipulate this as a json blob
  }

problem #2: custom Set<Object> and List<Object> do not behave
consistently with Map<String,Object>.

There are several conditions that allow for the subscription to a task
to be removed before the task factory has a chance to delete it. This
happens in very short lived tasks more often and results in warning
logs, which are benign, but look scary:

[DELETE (ctx id:null) to http://<ip>:<port>/core/callbacks/some-service-id,
from http://<ip>:<port>/mgmt/self-update-tasks/default failed: Service not found:

Core query task gets created on any node in the default node group,
but for FactoryService which is only available in a custom node
group, this creation of core query task at any node creates problem
when the node running the query task is not part of the custom
node group. Because on that node custom node-selector would not
exist and creation of broadcast query on that node would fail. To
overcome this problem we now use local query task instead of core
query task. Local query task will be created on the same node which
is running the synchronization task and hence will have the desired
custom node-selector service running on it. Also fixed the bug
in QueryTaskService to use right node-selector while calling the
forwarding service.

https://github.com/vmware/xenon/commit/5482ae6c251bf5d9c5ca981a0c43d6edb42e2616,"Do not return response body for 304 status code

Currently, when Operation has set
""Operation.STATUS_CODE_NOT_MODIFIED""(equivalent to 304), behavior was not
consistent between remote and local ops. For remote op, response body
contains same as request body(for owner-selection service). For local op,
the response operation contains body that whatever handler method set.

HTTP-304 spec defines behavior for a conditional GET request: ""The 304
response MUST NOT contain a message-body"".

In this change, to comply with http spec, response operation always has
empty body if status code is 304 regardless of remote or local.

The change needs to be made three parts of code - StatefulService,
StatelessService, and owner selected service.  For owner-selected service,
since it forwards the request to owner, the entry node behaves as a proxy.
When forwarded request returns response, it copies all parameters to actual
response operation. Previously, it skipped copying body if it was empty.
This ends up leaving original request body to response body. This was
updated to always copy the forwarded response body.

The HTTP-304 spec only defines behavior for GET, and it does NOT specify for
other http actions.  This change applies stretched interpretation of spec
and make same behavior for actions other than GET.  This is xenon's own
behavior that might change in future; so that, users should not rely on it.

Also, `STATUS_CODE_NOT_MODIFIED` is used to determine persisting the state
document in StatefulService.  Since having 304 for update request is not
appropriate, we should consider using different mechanism such as pragma
header.

On-demand start of a Stateful, persistent, non-replicated service that
does not exist leaves an attached service instance footprint in memory.

Typically when the target service of an operation is a child service
of a persistent factory, on-demand start kicks-in, but fails because
the service does not exist. The detection of non-existence typically
happens in the synchronization phase of the service start sequence.
However, in the case of a non-replicated service, synchornization
is skipped, and we ignore the non-existence. Note that even without
the fix the on-demand triggering op fails, as it should, as linked
state loading fails. However, memory footprint is left - the attached
service instance.

Queries for latest versions (those without INCLUDE_ALL_VERSIONS) fetch

This change loads data progressively, every time doubling the maxHits,
starting at the user-provided requestLimit*2 until it
reaches DEFAULT_QUERY_PAGE_RESULT_LIMIT. The downside is that the the

Remove the warning for setting resultLimit too low on COUNT queries and grow
the resultLimit the same way as for paginated queries.

Currently, Xenon tries to deserialize inbound requests with

Add support for synchronization of all versions:

* SynchronizationTaskService has an additional state field that controls
  whether all versions, not just the latest, should be synchronized
* 3 new pragmas have been added: PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_ALL_VERSIONS,
  PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_HISTORICAL_VERSIONS and PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_VERSION
* SynchronizationTaskService drives synchronization of factory children as
  usual, except that when synch-all-versions is enabled - it sets
  PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_ALL_VERSIONS on the synchOwner request it sends
  through the factory to the service owner
* A synchOwner request with PRAGMA_DIRECTIVE_SYNCH_ALL_VERSIONS is handled at
  the service owner side in two stages: in the first stage a regular
  synchOwner flow is executed. In the second stage only versions lower
  than the last version, if exist, are synchronized.
* NodeSelectorSynchronizationService uses a paginated broadcast + include-
  all-versions + numeric-range query to fetch the historical versions of the
  service and synchronize its peers.

While the infrastructure supports a per-factory config of synching the
latest or all version, currently only a global config is exposed through
the system property
xenon.SynchronizationTaskService.synchAllVersions.

Previously, accessing the paginated searcher cache is scattered around the
index-service code base.
In this commit, `PaginatedSearcherManager` class is introduced inside of
index-service and put all paginated searcher cache management into this class.
This doesn't change any functionality, rather it is a code cleanup of
index-service.

As part of the change, `PaginatedSearcherInfo` class is also moved to the
inside of the manager class.  Since this info class is internal to the cache,
ideally this should be scoped to private.  However, due to the references from
current test class, scope is kept as protected.

To verify existing functionality, I have not yet refactored the test class.
However, test class has many internal access to the paginated searcher cache
related code, they need to be cleaned up and separate testing for cache
management and general paginated searcher usage.
The test class refactoring is not part of the scope of this change.

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1471320/stories/152518950

During synchronization we issue a broadcast paginated query to find the

relatively short timeout - a 1/3 of the host operation's timeout - which
times out under heavy load (typically when netty connections expire which
causes a delay).

The fix is to use the full host operation's timeout, which can be set
by the application to deal with heavy load.

This change aims to do this:
* introduce a single entrypoint to access global config params from the
   environemnt

* Promote convention when introducing config params in the form of
  InterestedClass.propName. All configs that don't adhere to this convention
  are still read the old way.

* Enable reading configs from both sysprops and env vars: these two are
  equivalent:
  -Dxenon.MyConfigs.key=value
  export XENON_MY_CONFIG_KEY=value

  This makes it easier to parameterize xenon when run in container/pod.
  Inspired by https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig.

* User friendliness: durations can be given in millis, seconds,
  minutes, hours, days; micros are the default. These are equivalent:
  1h = 3600s = 3600000ms = 3600000000

* User friendliness: number parameters understand K,M,G suffixes. These
  are all equivalent:
  1M = 1m = 1024K = 1024k = ....

* Standadrd API to modify/restore configuration for test

* Clean-up constants used only in a scope of a few line (the property names and
  defaults)

* Debuggability: during host start, all properties read log why they get this
  value and whether the default is used (inspired by Java's  -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal)

All places when a config is read are changed to use the new API. This API is
not considered public yet. It may be advertised as such once stable enough.

1. Disable http2 for synch post operations. Currently HTTP2 netty
   stack is not processing all pending HTTP2 request in time which
   causes these sync posts to timeout. We should enable HTTP2
   as soon as we have fixed the timeout issue. Due to this bug,
   synchronization would consistently fail for large number of
   documents in 3 or more node cluster where a new node need to get
   synched.

2. Disable early expiration of synch operation. The quick expiration
   of operation in the synch task is not required.

3. Increase query task's expiration that is inherited by all child
   query tasks and broadcast queries and pages. This fixes major issue
   where some query pages were getting expired right after after
   creation if they were created after 10 minutes expiry of the parent
   query task.

4. Logs showing progress of synch task which is really helpful in
   troubleshooting and debugging.

5. Increase synch task exponential backoff retries from 8 to 10.
   The 10th retry will happen after around 17 minutes.

6. Gradually decrease query result limit on failures. Currently
   default result limit is 1000, but on failure we do the retry of

7. Synch task to start again as soon as there is node-group change.
   Previously we waited for all documents to be synched before
   starting the synch task again and causing the synch task to finish
   after long time because it would have finished synchronizing all
   thousands of services multiple times.

This is a continuation of:
https://review.ec.eng.vmware.com/#/c/21153/.

The issue fixed in this part is: a race between a STOP and an
on-demand start is causing intermitten failures in CI, as requests
get re-tried multiple times.

The fix is to create a new service instance in this case, just like
we do for a synch request. Detection of failure deleted / not-exists
happens downstream in the service start sequence.

When queries run in parallel with updates new searchers are created.
The searchers have to parse the FieldInfo from the disk and store it
indexed by name and number (as a FieldInfos instance). In a highly loaded
system the heap is dominiated by FieldInfo(s) instances while the unique
set of objects measures only in the thousands.

A bug in lucene FieldInfos (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8018)
prevents a TreeMap from being gc'ed as a view over it is retained.
The fix is to create a copy of the collection thus making
the parent TreeMap unreachable. Until we update to lucene 7.2 or 8.0,
the field is reassigned using reflection.

This reduces GC pressure a lot if a lot of
query tasks and paginated searcher are needed by an application.

As discussed in the last horizon team meeting, we plan to upgrade
jquery to jquery 3 series. Jquery 3 upgrade assumes we already use
jquery 1.12.x ro 2.2.x. We already use jquery 1.12.4.1 in the master
for long but our requirements file says >=1.8.2. This commit bumps
the xstatic-jquery minimum requirement to 1.12.4.1 to ensure
we use 1.12.x before upgrading jQuery to 3.

xstatic-jquery-ui min version is also bumped to 1.12.0.1.
The current requirement is >=1.10.4 but we use 1.12.x series for long
and use 1.12.1.1 since 2018, so I believe it is safe to bump it.

The issue was that the filtering opts like project_name, image_name,
flavor_name that are not supported by nova API (non-api filters) do
not work expectedly. These filters are mapped to their IDs [1], but
an instance list retrieved before resolving non-API filters is used [2].
This commit changes the logic to resolve non-API filters first and
then retrieve instances using the updated search_opts.

Note that the image list is handled a bit specially. If 'image_name'
is specified as a filter, we retrieve a corresponding image detail
first before fetching instances to resolve the image name into its ID.
Otherwise, we retrieve images only related to instances retrieved
and this happens after retrieving instances.

The scenario configuration in openstack_auth test_auth was ignored
somehow. Perhaps it happened when openstack_auth was merged into
the horizon repo as test runners used in the horizon repo so far
(django test runner, nose and pytest) do not support testscenarios.

This commit tries to recover the original intention of the scenario.
pytest supports several ways to parametrize tests [1]
but there seems no way without changing each test functions.
A quick port of ""testscenarios"" is explained [2],
but it is just a way to generate tests based on scenarios and
we still need to add scenario parameters to each test function,
so we cannot refer scenario parameters in setUp().
As a result, I chose a way to inherit the original class and
pass different attributes per scenario.
This is not ideal and I hope pytest lovers can improve the situation.

The test classes in test_auth are renamed to more meaningful ones.

Direct overrides of settings in test_auth.py are improved too.

In python3, super() does not always require a class and self reference.
In other words, super() is enough for most cases.
This is much simpler and it is time to switch it to the newer style.

pylint provides a check for this.
Let's enable 'super-with-arguments' check.

NOTE: _prepare_mappings() method of FormRegion in
openstack_dashboard/test/integration_tests/regions/forms.py is refactored.
super() (without explicit class and self referece) does not work when
a subclass method calls a same method in a parent class multiple times.
It looks better to prepare a separate method to provide a common logic.

`coverage run pytest` runs coverage against the tests in a file called
""pytest"", whereas `coverage run -m pytest` uses pytest as the test
runner, which is what we really want here.

To avoid duplicated maitenance of pytest arguments,
unit_tests.sh is updated to handle the coverage run.

Introduce the new https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_fuzzing library for fuzz testing support.

The new library provides new functionality (support for testing the fuzz test locally) and simplifies existing fuzzing tasks. This is the first PR in the series. See #14675 for the detailed rollout plan.

Risk Level: Low (new dependencies and major change to the existing envoy_cc_fuzz_test macro, but does not affect Envoy binary)
Testing: The changes consist of either (a) code that should be a drop-in replacement to the existing functionality, or (b) new targets marked as ""manual"". For (a), the Envoy regression tests should catch deviations from the original behavior. The new functionality in (b) is either tested manually, or through the OSS-Fuzz integration (changes coming in future PR).
Docs Changes: None (this is test-only functionality).
Release Notes: N/A

Enable reading larger chunks from sockets in a single call without drastically increasing memory waste by implementing a system where reservations of multiple slices are made, and unused slices (after the read operation) are put into a small cache for re-use by the next read operation.

The largest read operation changed from 16k to 128k.

Watermark buffer limits are still enforced; large reads only happen if buffer limits allow and space is available.

This improves performance in some high-throughput use cases.

When a listener config contains an Any proto with an unknown proto type, the config

crashing Envoy. This PR renames the unsafe proto-to-JSON conversion function

When a downstream request's headers do not follow the transcoding specification:

Current behavior: The filter blindly passes the request through to the upstream. This works well when the request is already a gRPC request, but is not ideal if the :path is malformed.

New behavior: For cases where the :path is malformed, the filter will reject the request instead of passing it through. This includes paths that are not registered for transcoding and unknown query parameter variable bindings. gRPC requests are still passed through.

Risk Level: Low. Backwards compatible, new behavior is guarded by option. I cannot think of a case where a client would prefer the old behavior, but let's be safe with breaking changes.

https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/commit/77cbaeae216d22febed0ad36d8413822017cf46d,"Add help text to Register DHCP Leases in Resolver

This change adds a sentence to the help text for the `Register DHCP Leases in the DNS Resolver` input field. 

Enabling this option has the non-obvious side effect of reloading Unbound each time a client obtains a DHCP lease. This reload flushes the resolution cache, which can mean long recursive lookups being required for even frequently used domains. 

A long term fix for this issue would be to modify the Unbound scripts so that the resolution cache is persisted somehow between reloads, but in the short term this addition should help users avoid this pitfall.

This issue comes up in the forums from time to time, and I know that personally I long avoided using Unbound in recursive mode because I couldn't figure out why performance was sometimes poor on frequently used domains. Turns out it was because I had this option turned on.

This change moves test data into the binaries rather than reading them from
the disk at runtime.

Advantages:
- Tests become distributable
- Cross-compile friendly. Build on one machine and execute in an arbitrary
  location on another.
- Easier testing for backports. Users can verify that tests pass without having
  to track down corresponding test data.
- More trustworthy test results and easier quality assurance as tests make
  fewer assumptions about their environment.
- Tests could theoretically run at client/daemon startup and exit on failure.

Disadvantages:
- Required 'hexdump' build-dependency. This is a standard bsd tool that should
  be usable everywhere. It is likely already installed on all build-machines.
- Tests can no longer be fudged after build by altering test-data.",,,

libleveldb.a and libmemenv.a should be able to build in parallel, but in

.mk, the make ends up in an undefined state.

HAVE_SECCOMP_NOTIFY is defined in lxcseccomp.h if both HAVE_SECCOMP and

Everytime we try to discover an address we want to publish, emit a log notice
if we are unable to find it even though an ORPort was configured for it.

Because the function can be called quite often, we rate limit that notice to
every hour so it gets annoying just enough so the operator fixes that.

We would before do an address discovery and then a lookup in the cache if not

which does all those combined.

Furthermore, by doing so, we won't trigger an address discovery every minute
if we have no ORPort configured for the family.

Now that relay_find_addr_to_publish() checks if we actually have an ORPort, we
can simplify the descriptor building phase for IPv6.

This also avoid triggering an IPv6 discovery if the IPv4 can't be found in the
first place.

* Added check for zero in n2base.

* Removed old failing tests.

* Added some tests (failing).

* Extended 'format' function with 'base' and 'wordSize' options and changed 'bin', 'oct', and 'hex' to use 'format' function.

* Fixed lint issues.

* Fixed issues related to the merge.

* Corrected a test.

* Fixed bignumber formatter.

* Added tests for math.format with 'base' and 'wordSize' options.

* Add unit parser benchmark

* Add LRU to memoize function

* Memoize _findUnit

This fixes some performance issues in my heavily-unit-parsing app.
Another idea might be to do an index of reversed unit names, and search
in that, but this is much easier to implement and still should provide
an improvement in the majority of cases (since I'd imagine that most
users tend to prefer a few units at a time, depending on their
application).

* Optimize memoize function

This should be just a little bit faster than before by using Maps, which
have less overhead than javascript objects.",,,

Previously, callers were expected to call match_entity against a given

validation implementation itself.

Original commit by @lstarnes1024, edited by @aaronmdjones to further
remove the flag that it depended on, now that it has no use. Shuffling
the other flag up after it is okay because the only user of this flag
is saslserv/main, and reloading that will reload all other saslserv
modules anyway, so there is no ABI concern.

Providing an empty action-if-not-found argument for PKG_CHECK_MODULES

effect) instead; we don't require any of these libraries.

This allows the configure script to succeed on a freshly-installed
machine without the libraries in question installed.

Further, warn the user that pkg-config is missing if it is. This is
necessary for a lot of the library detection tests, unless the user
manually specifies LIBFOO_CFLAGS and LIBFOO_LIBS on the ./configure
command-line, which we don't want to encourage, and is provided only
for compatibility with weird operating systems that install libraries
into paths that its toolchain does not look for libraries in.

https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/647556cc822a34ff128e43de7f3f8fa4a3a9ed6b,"nickserv/info: Make private times more private

The previous approach rounded the elapsed time down to weeks, which does
reduce the resolution of last seen times to a week over one observation.
Unfortunately, if we're allowed multiple observations, we can zero in on
the time the low-resolution clock ticks over.

The solution used here is to reduce the resolution of the last-seen time
itself. Since the time is not changing, this happens the same way each
time, and subsequent observations reveal no information. This is not
perfect on its own: it discloses high-resolution information about users
who were last seen at the beginning of the current Atheme week, since
they couldn't have been last seen in the future. We deal with this by
representing both 0- and 1-week differences as ""less than two
weeks ago"".

Finally, this is of limited value as long as we reveal the
high-resolution fact that a user is online now. We dispense with this
and show an obfuscated time for private users regardless of
logged-in status.",,,

During an saslserv/main reload, some modules (such as SCRAM) can end up
registering their mechanisms twice. We should ignore that; it pollutes
the mechanism list propagated to servers.

[ci skip]",,,
https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/d94294d7e7a1cb91b80efd060fe7b7414a109143,"modules/saslserv/scram: provide correct mechanism to use on mismatch

When a client tries to login with e.g. SCRAM-SHA-512 but their database
credentials were calculated with SHA2-256, indicate to the client that
SCRAM-SHA-256 is the only acceptable SASL SCRAM method for login. This
is done by recalculating a new SASL mechanism list, against a list of
mechanisms to /avoid/ putting into the list, and then sending that list
to the client (but not telling servers to set their general mechanism
list to it, as that would affect other clients). The list of mechanisms
to avoid is calculated based on the database credentials, which we only
know after receiving a username from the client.

As an aside, I am rather disappointed with the design of SCRAM, in
particular its choice to leave negotiation of digest algorithm out of
band. This would be much cleaner if the mechanism was just named ""SCRAM""
(or ""SCRAM-PLUS""), and the server could indicate (in the server's first
message) which digest algorithm the client should use to calculate
SaltedPassword, ClientKey, & ServerKey. As it stands, we can only fail
the mechanism if the digest algorithm implied by the SASL mechanism name
doesn't match the digest algorithm used to calculate the database
credentials, and then hope that the client eventually falls back to the
correct mechanism.

This commit aids that fallback process for IRCv3.1 networks (IRCv3.2
networks will have the full mechlist as a value of the sasl= capability,
so clients always know which mechanisms it should try). To that end, we
also put a note in the documentation that deploying SCRAM on IRCv3.1
networks is discouraged.",,,

to preserve precision. A literal jv_number will only need conversion to
double once, and will reuse the resultant double on subsequent
conversions.

Outputting literal jv_numbers preserves the original precision.

[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) is an app I have maintained
for the past 4-5 years with the goal of getting people involved in
Open Source projects like this one. The app sends subscribers a random
open issue for them to help ""triage"". For some languages you can also
suggested areas to add documentation.

The initial approach was inspired by seeing the work of the small
core team spending countless hours asking ""what version was
this in"" and ""can you give us an example app"". The idea is to
outsource these small interactions to a huge team of volunteers
and let the core team focus on their work.

I want to add a badge to the README of this project. The idea is to
provide an easy link for people to get started contributing to this
project. A badge indicates the number of people currently subscribed
to help the repo. The color is based off of open issues in the project.

Here are some examples of other projects that have a badge in their
README:

- https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal
- https://github.com/rails/rails
- https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage

Since quagga-1.2.0, the Next Hop validation for directly connected peers
using IPv6 does not work.

In this setup, BGP updates contain two next hops: a global IPv6 address and
a link-local IPv6 address (a correct behavior according to RFC 2545).  This
means that the length of the next hop attribute is 32 and not 16.

The problem comes from the function ""make_prefix()"" in ""bgpd/bgp_nht.c"".  It
refuses to build a prefix structure for a route when the length of the
[Anext hop attribute is different from 16, even if a valid global IPv6
address is available.

The route is mistakenly considered invalid and thus, it is not installed in
the routing table.

Details: ""make_prefix()"" was not modified in quagga-1.2.0 but its
interpretation was changed in commit
3dda6b3eccb9a2a88d607372c83c04c796e7daac.  Before this commit, the failure
of ""make_prefix()"" was interpreted as a successful validation of the next
hop.",,,

* Prior band-aids were made to address use-after-frees in lib/filter

  access-list being deleted to be visible by access_list_lookup from
  the users' delete callback, causing deleted access-list references to
  not be removed, leading to different use-after-frees instead.

  Fix in a robust manner within the filter code.

  This bug was reported and debugged by matt@kontoff.com, with an
  initial fix, on which this commit builds.  See
  https://bugzilla.quagga.net/show_bug.cgi?id=945.

* filter.h: Change the callback hooks to take the access-list name, not
  the access-list reference.  The name can be a weaker, more opaque
  ref.
* filter.c: Update hooks calls to pass name.

  guard strcmp of name, as name may now potentially be NULL for access-lists
  in process of being deleted.
  (access_list_filter_delete) Transfer ownership of the access-list name
  to a local, so the access-list can be deleted, and the name then passed

  being deleted here, but better safe.

https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/commit/0dab2494ca5e20c5ab90ea7fbe11ada1316e41ee,"Bluetooth: Match control procedure requests with responses

This makes it easier to read logs where both the master
and slave initiate control procedures at the same time.
Retransmitted packets are not part of the request/response
tracing.

In order to perform the analysis, direction information must
be available.

The matching is implemented by storing control procedure contexts
for each direction for each connection object as each direction
may initiate its own procedure.

Limitations:
- When there is a control procedure violation where a device
  initiates a new procedure before the previous is complete,
  only the first procedure is traced.
  It would be possible to create more advanced tracing by
  storing a list of contexts per frame.
  However, as this is anyways a specification violation, this
  adds unnecessary complexity.
- Control procedures involving an instant are marked as completed
  when the last frame is sent even though the control procedure
  is completed when the instant is reached.
  This is the best possible approach when the event counter is
  not available.
  Due to this limitation, we are not able to detect the control
  procedure violation where a device initiates a new procedure
  before the instant is reached.

The following control procedure violations are detected:
- Starting a control procedure before the previous is complete.
  Control procedure violations where a new procedure is started
  before the instant is reached is currently not detected.
  That requires knowing the event counter.
- Control procedure packets that are not valid responses to an
  existing ongoing control procedure.

wiretap/nettrace_3gpp_32_423.c and meant to eventually replace both.
(Currently only replaces the latter.)

Since most of Wireshark expects ISO 8601 date-times to fit a fairly
strict pattern, iso8601_to_nstime() currently rejects date-times without
separators between the components, even though ISO 8601 actually permits
this. This could be revisited later.

Old behaviour is to read the entire file into memory at once; provide
the XML tree as the first packet; and then individual `<msg>` elements
as subsequent packets. It did this by writing to a temporary pcapng
file.

This change causes the XML file to only be read a chunk at a time (and
be read directly, not through an intermediate pcapng). This means much
larger files can be loaded, at the cost of no longer showing the raw XML
as the first packet. This is not a loss because the file can be loaded
in MIME Files Format (or a text editor) to see the XML.

Much of the logic from the old functions `create_temp_pcapng_file()` and
`write_packet_data()` has been relocated into the new function
`nettrace_msg_to_packet()`, and is used to directly generate packet data
for wiretap instead of writing it to a temporary file.

Also includes some initial ""code smell"" fixes:

- Removed some duplicate `#define`s from epan/exported_pdu.h
- Replaces some magic numbers with macros from epan/exported_pdu.h
- Replaces other magic numbers with the CLEN() macro to make it easier
  to see (and debug) where sizes/offsets come from
- Use `g_strstr_len()` instead of `strstr()` to remove the need to
  insert string terminators
- Uses direct pointer math instead of indexing into a byte array

This compiles and runs, and seems to produce the same results as the old
reader (except for the XML packet). Consider it a proof of concept; it
needs further revision before being review-ready.",,,

In MPTCP v1, in the MPC handshake, the first key is carried by

the forward direction comes from the server. That is the opposite
of what used to happen with MPTCP v0 - the initial SYN already
carried the sender key.

As a result, when a later MP_JOIN subflows attach to an existing

flow, and the relative DSN/ACK_SEQ decoding for such flows gives
pseudo-random results.

    enumValueOption = optionName  ""="" ( constant | customOptionValue ) "";""
    fieldOption = optionName  ""="" ( constant | customOptionValue ) "";""

Add parsing of RFC 7440 ""TFTP Windowsize Option"" and the Microsoft-proprietary
""msftwindow"" option seen in Windows Deployment Services (WDS) PXE.  I have
found no spec or documentation for the latter, so it is reverse-engineered from
various packet captures of WDS boot.

In the RRQ, WRQ, and OACK, parse the ""windowsize"" and ""msftwindow"" options.  I
haven't seen ""msftwindow"" in an WRQ, only in an RRQ and corresponding OACK, but
I have implemented it symmetrically in the WRQ in this change.

In the ACK, parse the extra byte added when ""msftwindow"" is active (containing
the dynamic window size) and add it to the protocol tree.  Include a ""chat""
expert info for changes in window size, since changes in packet queue depth
might indirectly trigger defects in a PXE implementation.",,,

Re c918cf4aab8a56d3ab62b6fee8706995f9b69497

The proper fix is to add the missing extends clause in the event, not
add a bunch of abstract methods. (see 662d823ac7)

Somehow, unit test and phpstan were happy with it.

This commit is a port of https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/pull/2872
e317a4c41cf31055dd72cbdacf7f3bccb53d407f

MySQL does not offer deterministic order bys. This leads to problems
where the user could see records move in the list or see a record that
was displayed in the previous page, which it not nice UX.

It is up to the programmer to create a deterministic sort. When the
fields contains mostly random data, the problem is not visible. But when
there are multiple records with the same value, the problem becomes
apparent: our order by clause is not unique.

The simplest fix I could find was to add the entry id as the last order
by clause. This clause needs to follow the same sort direction, to make
sure the last item becomes the first one when the order is flipped.

To be able to work with non-unique values we can now use
rowsGroupedByColumn() which will return an array of arrays, so many

This will give us accurate stack traces in the browser, and generally
make debugging client-side code easier.

Note that there is a pr to merge this functionality into meteor core:

https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/10341

...but which is stalled on some things Sandstorm doesn't actually care
about (notably, many developers don't actually want to expose the source
to end-users, they want the source maps uploaded to a CI or something,
but Sandstorm is FOSS so we absolutely _do_ want users to have the
source).

can switch over to using meteor core's support.",,,

There are two problems:

1. Davros apparently makes /var/www itself a symlink to another

2. We need to call Path::parse() on the path. Apparently I didn't test
   this thoroughly enough after changing raiiOpenAtIfExistsContained
   to take a kj::Path rather than a string.

We fix (1) by allowing /var/www itself to be a symlink, and then only
enforcing that symlinks within that directory do not point outside of
it.

In the vm created by vagrant-spk, sandstorm-http-bridge currently fails
to build, apparently because the implementation of insertSession() ends
up selecting the (deleted) copy constructor for SessionRecord. This
doesn't seem to be the case on my usual dev system, where this was
building just fine.

Perhaps the difference lies in the version of the C++ stdlib (the
compilers should be the same), but why these are different is stretching
the limits of my C++ knowledge.

...but using the copy constructor here is actually fine, since
SessionRecord doesn't own any of its data anyway. So I guess we can just
allow this.

The build failure was reported on the mailing list by @troyjfarrell,

TIFFRGBAImageGet does not properly handle a non-zero col_offset in the
TIFFRGBAImage structure passed as the first argument.  The current (incorrect)
behaviour depends upon the organization of the input tiff file as follows:

1.  If the TIFF is stripped, col_offset is completely ignored.
2.  If the TIFF is tiled, the image result is shifted to the left to the
nearest tile boundary.  For example, if the tilewidth is 100, col_offset is
125, and requested width is 200, you get an image with pixels from 100 up to
300, not 125 up to 325 as expected.

This problem was reported in the mailing list previously as follows, but no
action was taken:

1.  http://www.asmail.be/msg0054834339.html although Andrew is wrong about
tiled images working fine.

The problem is that TIFF library attempts to write TIFF header as soon as the
tiff2pdf utility initializes the library. Fortunately, the library contains an
I/O abstraction feature, so there are no hardcoded writes to a file descriptor
anywhere. In particular, it appears that the utility's output suppression
feature can be used to suppress the initial write of the header.",,,

An issue on GitHub (https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools/issues/94)
raises the issue that errors that used to be treated
as non-fatal in earlier versions of Unsquashfs are now
treated as fatal, and that they set the exit code to nonzero.

Additionally, -ignore-errors can be used to make
Unsquashfs behave more like earlier versions, but, the
exit code is still set to nonzero.

This change in behaviour is deliberate, and it is in
response to requests to harden the error handling
of Unsquashfs, including always setting the exit code
(including non fatal errors).

But it is clear some people still want the original
behaviour where non-fatal errors did not set the
exit code.

This commit adds the -no-exit-code option which
will disable setting of the exit code when
non fatal errors occur.

An issue on Github (https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools/issues/77)
raises the problem that symlinks in extract files are
not followed.  So if the extract file pathname ends with a
symlink (leaf component) it is extracted and left as a
dangling symlink, unless the real file it links to is
also specified as an extract file.

Additionally, if the extract file pathname traverses
symlinks while walking the pathname (i.e. non leaf
symlinks), the extraction will stop at this point.  In
this case the extract target (leaf component) will not
be extracted.  Here the problem isn't a dangling
symlink, but rather no symlink and nothing else
in the pathname followed.

One way of solving this is by dereferencing the symlink(s),
and replacing them with what they actually link to, in a
similar way to ""cp -L"".

But this is dangerous, and can cause Unsquashfs to produce
output which does not match the input Squashfs filesystem,
which is something Unsquashfs should never do.

The reason for this is whereas ""cp -L"" is derefencing
the *input*, Unsquashfs is dereferencing the *output*.

If a filesystem has a real filename, say

	a/b/c/hello_world

and two symlinks

a/symlink1 ---> b/c/hello_world
a/symlink2 ---> b/c

There are multiple different ways (or paths) to the *single*
hello_world file.

a/b/c/hello_world
a/symlink1
a/symlink2/hello_world

If Unsquashfs was given all three paths as extract files, and
Unsquashfs dereferenced them on output, you will get
*three* copies of the hello_world file, and two copies of
directory ""c"".

Superficially the output may look the same, but, it may
not work the same, and obviously edits to the one hello_world
file will not get reflected in the other copies.

Any option that can be accidently or maliciously used to produce
such an output is too dangerous to be added.

This commit solves the problem in an equivalent way, but which
does not alter the output, and so it is a completely safe option.

An extract file with symlinks is ultimately unresolvable because
it is not the canonical pathname to the file (that is the one
without symlinks), and without that the real filename and path
will not be extracted.

Additionally, if an extract file with symlinks references other
symlinks, then it is also unresolvable because these symlinks
will also not appear in the output.

Therefore to make an extract file with symlinks resolvable you
have to find the canonical pathname to the file, and add it
as an extract file.  Additionally any symlinks found while
resolving it also have to be added as an extract file.  Once
done the extract file will be resolvable.

The XHTML standard encompasses the XML standard.

From the beginning, the XML standard [1] has always included required
support for five character entities:

 1. the ampersand (&) as &amp;
 2. the left angle bracket (<) as &lt;
 3. the right angle bracket (>) as &gt;
 4. the double-quote character ("") as &quot;
 5. the apostrophe or single-quote character (') as &apos;

See section ""2.4 Character Data and Markup"" of the XML standard [1]
for further details.

Add support for the character single-quote character entity (&apos;)
in order to fully support XHTML pages.

This is based on a library I've been working on called `hakari` that's
built on top of guppy. The basic guarantee that `hakari` provides is
that all third-party dependencies are built in exactly the same way, no
matter which package is currently being built. This should help speed up
local developer builds significantly since a combinatorial explosion of
third-party dependency feature sets is prevented.

Included is:
* a new command, `cargo x generate-workspace-hack`, that by default
  generates new contents for `diem-workspace-hack` (it can also be run
  in diff mode).
* a lint that ensures the contents of the file are up-to-date.

This includes builds for three platforms: x86_64 Linux, Mac, and
PowerPC. We can add more platforms in the future.",,,

If current time hour was ""2300"" hours, and you added ""4"" hours to that,
you would end up with 2700 hours.  Since that could NEVER match a raid
hour, the code would perpetually decide that the raid was not frozen.

Bugfix: Old date code would only freeze a raid if you were viewing the
raid on the same year, month, day, and hour as the raid started on.
If one of those did not match the system would return that the raid was
not frozen.

- optimize MPTT pointer rebuilding for leaf nodes (i.e. non-albums).
- reverse order_by to try and preserve existing tree ordering.
- reset item level while we're here.
- use ""$stack[] = 123"" instead of array_push($stack, 123) since it's faster.
